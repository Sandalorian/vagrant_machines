# Vagrant Machine

This is a list of Vagrant machine that I find useful for setting up environment quickly.

Click on the below links to see more information on each machine.

1. angular
2. ansible
3. ActiveDirectory

## Usage

I have only tested these machines on **Windows 10** and therefore I'm not sure if there are issues on other host machines.

There are some prerequisite that are required before being able to use this repository:

- Vagrant 2.2.7
- VirtualBox 6.0.8

Once installed, it's a simple case of:
1. Cloning the Github repository, 
2. Navigating to the respective machines directory,
3. Run `vagrant up`
